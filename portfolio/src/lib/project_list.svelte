The system addresses problems of passengers regarding safety, driverâ€™s behavior, information materials and service adequacy by providing several information using Flutter and Firebase. In order to adress these factors, several features were developed. These features include: Realtime GPS Location, Fare Matrix, Basic Information, Passenger Counter, Rough Time Estimation, Feedback System (5 star system and text feedback), Report System, Passenger Demand System, Account System, and various Route Manager Features like editing the route and verifying drivers.",

Svelte was used to build the desktop webpage and Python was utilized to perform various data science techniques on the data. Few graphs were made to show the data in an efficient manner. The results show inconsistent changes in electricity price and how generation and distribution charges heavily affect it.",
